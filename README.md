## This repository include 5 challenging embedded programming I finished in 2017-2018

- The "EE2A" is the course's code, just ignore it:D
- Each task requirement is shown in .pdf files
- The first 4 tasks are about microprocesser, so the answers(C code) are shown directly in .c files
- The last task is runned in FPGA, so a seperate file folder contained the simulation and the code
- Some of the code are used in IMP as well
- The index of experiments is start from 2 because the first experiment is not about coding :(
